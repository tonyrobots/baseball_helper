Stuff to do:

1. Lots of clean up, I'm rusty and not making the best structural decisions ATM
2. Add "roster" entity -- so users can create rosters and have quick access to their players
3. This would be best served by having users/auth
4. distinguish between split seasons/full seasons on player index
5. Supplement player database with additional/external data (e.g. Games Played!)
6. currently Batters and pitchers are completely separate entities -- find way to share better, e.g. have Player object they each inherit from
